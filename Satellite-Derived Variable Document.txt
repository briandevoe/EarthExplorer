**Satellite-Derived Variable Documentation for Environmental Indicators**

This document provides descriptions and context for each of the remote sensing variables used in the `Nationwide Satellite Export` script. These variables are derived from Google Earth Engine (GEE) image collections and represent different environmental or urban conditions. Where applicable, the limitations and modeling assumptions are also noted.

### Vegetation and Land Use Indices

**1. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 5 and 4)
**Formula:** `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
**Description:** Measures vegetation health and greenness. Values near +1 indicate healthy green vegetation; values near 0 or negative indicate urban or barren land.

**2. NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 3 and 5)
**Formula:** `(Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)`
**Description:** Highlights water features and soil moisture. Useful for identifying surface water and wet areas.

**3. NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 6 and 5)
**Formula:** `(SWIR - NIR) / (SWIR + NIR)`
**Description:** Detects built-up (urban) areas. High values suggest high-density construction or impervious surfaces.

**4. LST (Land Surface Temperature)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 Thermal Band 10
**Formula:** `ST_B10 * 0.00341802 + 149.0`
**Description:** Estimates surface temperature in Kelvin. Useful for heat exposure studies and urban heat island effects.

**5. Turbidity Index**
**Source:** Landsat 9 Green Band (SR\_B3)
**Description:** A proxy measure for water turbidity, based on surface reflectance. Elevated reflectance suggests suspended sediments or algal presence. Not a direct measurement of pollutants.

### Air Quality and Atmospheric Variables

**6. CO (Carbon Monoxide Concentration)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI), `COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_CO`
**Description:** Indicates combustion sources such as wildfires, vehicles, and industrial emissions. High values may correlate with urban pollution or fire events.

**7. NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide Concentration)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P, `COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2`
**Description:** A major urban pollutant. Strongly associated with vehicle emissions and industrial activity. Useful for studying respiratory health disparities.

**8. OZONE (O3 Column Number Density)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P, `COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_O3`
**Description:** Measures ozone concentration in the atmosphere. Elevated levels at ground level are harmful to health and contribute to smog.

**9. AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth)**
**Source:** MODIS, `MODIS/006/MCD19A2_Optical_Depth_Land`
**Variable:** `Optical_Depth_Land_Mean_Mean`
**Description:** Measures the extinction of sunlight by aerosols in the atmosphere. Correlated with particulate matter (e.g., PM2.5). **Proxy for PM2.5** â€” not a direct measurement but often used in models estimating fine particle pollution. Spatial resolution and retrieval may vary by region and cloud conditions.

### Infrastructure and Activity

**10. Nighttime Lights (VIIRS Radiance)**
**Source:** VIIRS-DNB (Day/Night Band), `NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG`
**Variable:** `avg_rad`
**Description:** Indicates human presence, infrastructure, and economic activity. High radiance values correspond to urban centers, roads, and electrified regions.

### Notes on Data Use

* **Temporal Aggregation:** All variables are monthly composites (means or medians).
* **Spatial Resolution:** Most variables are at 30m (Landsat) or coarser for atmospheric datasets (MODIS: 1km+, Sentinel-5P: 7km).
* **Limitations:** Cloud cover, spatial gaps, or sensor artifacts may affect quality. Always consider QA masks or anomaly screening during post-processing.
