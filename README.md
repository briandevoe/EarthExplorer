EarthExplorer is a research tool for extracting and analyzing satellite-derived environmental indicators using Google Earth Engine and Python. This project generates monthly, high-resolution geospatial datasets across the U.S. ‚Äî including NDVI, surface temperature, air pollution, flood risk, and more ‚Äî and links them to census tracts for integration with social indices like the Child Opportunity Index (COI), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Opportunity Atlas (OA). The goal is to support environmental justice, public health research, and data-driven policymaking by bridging remote sensing and social science.

## üå± Potential Indicators for Expansion

This section outlines additional environmental and social indicators that can be integrated into the EarthExplorer project. Many of these are available through Google Earth Engine or public datasets and align well with measures like the Child Opportunity Index (COI), Social Vulnerability Index (SVI), and Opportunity Atlas (OA).

These are additional spatial indicators under consideration to enhance linkage with the Child Opportunity Index (COI). Most are available from public satellite data via Google Earth Engine and can be computed monthly and at high resolution.
