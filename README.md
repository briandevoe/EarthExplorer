## ðŸŒŽ Variables and Descriptions

### Vegetation and Land Use Indices

**1. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 5 and 4)
**Formula:** `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + NIR)`
**Description:** Measures vegetation health and greenness. Values near +1 indicate healthy vegetation; values near 0 or negative indicate urban/barren areas.

**2. NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 3 and 5)
**Formula:** `(Green - NIR) / (Green + NIR)`
**Description:** Highlights surface water features and moisture presence.

**3. NDBI (Normalized Difference Built-up Index)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 (Bands 6 and 5)
**Formula:** `(SWIR - NIR) / (SWIR + NIR)`
**Description:** Identifies urban and built-up areas.

**4. LST (Land Surface Temperature)**
**Source:** Landsat 9 Thermal Band 10
**Formula:** `ST_B10 * 0.00341802 + 149.0`
**Description:** Estimates surface temperature in Kelvin.

**5. Turbidity Index**
**Source:** Landsat 9 Green Band (SR\_B3)
**Description:** Proxy for water turbidity based on reflectance; not a direct pollution measure.

### Air Quality and Atmospheric Variables

**6. CO (Carbon Monoxide)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P (`COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_CO`)
**Description:** Indicates air pollution from fires, cars, industry.

**7. NOâ‚‚ (Nitrogen Dioxide)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P (`COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_NO2`)
**Description:** A major urban pollutant linked to traffic and respiratory health impacts.

**8. OZONE (Oâ‚ƒ Column)**
**Source:** Sentinel-5P (`COPERNICUS/S5P/OFFL/L3_O3`)
**Description:** Measures ozone concentration; ground-level ozone is a health hazard.

**9. AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth)**
**Source:** MODIS (`MODIS/006/MCD19A2_Optical_Depth_Land`)
**Description:** Indicates the level of aerosols (airborne particles) in the atmosphere. **Acts as a proxy for PM2.5**, although it is not a direct measurement. Often used in modeling fine particulate pollution.

### Infrastructure and Activity

**10. Nighttime Lights (Radiance)**
**Source:** VIIRS-DNB (`NOAA/VIIRS/DNB/MONTHLY_V1/VCMSLCFG`)
**Variable:** `avg_rad`
**Description:** Reflects human infrastructure, activity, and electrification.

### Notes on Data

* **Temporal Scope:** All data are monthly means/medians.
* **Spatial Scope:** 30m (Landsat); 1km+ (MODIS, Sentinel-5P).
* **Caveats:** Cloud cover, data quality, and atmospheric conditions may introduce gaps or biases. QA masks are recommended during analysis.
